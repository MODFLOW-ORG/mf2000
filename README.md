## Overview of MODFLOW-2000

MODFLOW-2000 is a three-dimensional finite-difference ground-water model that represents a general update to MODFLOW. It simulates steady and nonsteady flow in an irregularly shaped flow system in which aquifer layers can be confined, unconfined, or a combination of confined and unconfined. Flow from external stresses, such as flow to wells, areal recharge, evapotranspiration, flow to drains, and flow through river beds, can be simulated.

MODFLOW-2000 has a modular structure that allows it to be easily modified to adapt the code for a particular application. In addition to simulating ground-water flow, the scope of MODFLOW-2000 has been expanded to incorporate related capabilities such as solute transport and parameter estimation.
